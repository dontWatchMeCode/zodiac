# ZODIAC Schedule Image Generator

This application lets you automatically generate schedule images, as seen by various streamers and VTubers!

![Example Image](example.png)

The way this image is generated is by event entries which are stored in a local SQLite3 database, and a [Grimoire](https://github.com/Enalye/grimoire) script that controls how the image should be drawn. It allows for lots of flexibility, so with imagination the sky's the limit!

The API reference for the scripting part can be found [here](docs/index.md)!
